Time, it needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there
I will be there

Fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can break down the wall someday
I will be there
I will be there
